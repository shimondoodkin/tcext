tcext - Quick Extension Creation Script for Tiny Core Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I wanted to make it easy to create extensions
So more people will be able to do it
Also I wanted that people will provide inside the extensions
A tutorial how to make an extension

This script makes your life simpler
Now you have time to Describe your work, Reread the extention info, and Make more extensions
 
I have developed an extension creation script
I hope I did not reinvented the wheel

Easy as sequance of commands:

   wget http://somewebsite.com/downloaded_app_source.tar.gz
   tar -vxf cd downloaded_app_source.tar.gz
   cd downloaded_app_source

   tcext tools    # loads extensions required to compile programs
   
   tcext info    #creates or edits tcext.info file in current directory
   tcext configure --option     # same as ./configure --option
   tcext make    # same as #make but with cpu options 

   #put additional extension files in ./tcfiles, ex: tcfiles/etc/settings.conf.sample

   #make an init script (to copy /etc/settings.conf.sample to /etc/settings.conf):

   tcext script    # to edit/create the init script
   tcext install    # same as #make install
   #at this point you can see the result tcz in ./tcout

   #additionally you can use load / unload / reload to test your work
   tcext load    # copies the tcz to tce/optional and loads it

Basicaly you are done!

   #also you can do
   tcext unload    # tries to unload the extention

   # when you develop your extension, and you need to modify a file in ./tcfiles, you can do:
   tcext reload    # re-copies ./tcfiles ,  makes package, unloads, loads
   #now you can try your extension again  ;)

   #before publishing make sure to run info again
   tcext info    #creates or edits tcext.info file in current directory
   #and redo all the installs:  tcext install ,tcext installdocs, tcext installdev


Installation:
~~~~~~
to download you need curl extension

    tce-load -wi curl.tcz

    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/
    curl --insecure https://raw.github.com/shimondoodkin/tcext/master/tcext -o /home/tc/.local/bin/tcext

make it executible 

    chmod +x ~/.local/bin/tcext

development-note: clone the repository and make a link to tcext in repo instead of putting a file there
