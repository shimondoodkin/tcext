Also I wanted that people will provide inside the extensions

I have developed an extension creation script
I hope I did not reinvented the wheel

Easy as:
cd /project_folder
   tcext tools    # loads extensions required to compile programs
   
   tcext info    #creates or edits tcext.info file in current directory
   tcext configure --option     # same as ./configure --option
   tcext make    # same as #make

#put additional extension files in ./tcfiles, ex: tcfiles/etc/settings.conf.sample

#make an init script (to copy /etc/settings.conf.sample to /etc/settings.conf):

   tcext script    # to edit the init script
   tcext install    # same as #make install
#see the result tcz in ./tcout

#additionally you can use load / unload / reload to test your work
   tcext load    # copies the tcz to tce/optional and loads it
#also you can do
   tcext unload    # tries to unload the extention

# when you develop your extension, and you need to modify a file in ./tcfiles, you can do:
   tcext reload    # re-copies ./tcfiles ,  makes package, unloads, loads
#now you can try your extension again  ;)

#before publishing make sure to run info again
   tcext info    #creates or edits tcext.info file in current directory
#and redo all the installs:tcext install ,tcext installdocs, tcext installdev
